            commands r (robocopy) and d (deduplication)
	    
06-06-2021: 51.31
            -715 Works just about like v7.15
	    
22-05-2021: 51.23
            First "working" stage of -utf, -fix255, fixeml
	    
18-05-2021: 51.22
            A lot of work, experimental extraction of too long filename (and many more)

05-04-2021: 51.10
            New branch: single source code (zpaqfranz.cpp), to make it easier to package for FreeBSD and later Linux
	    
03-04-2021: 50.22
            With sha1 ... -all runs hash in multithread (DO NOT USE ON MAGNETIC DISKS!)
	    With sha1 ... -verify compute XXH3 of the entire tree

01-04-2021: 50.21
            Use XXH3 (128 bit version) instead of xxhash64
	    Refined -noeta -pakka in sha1()
	    
29-03-2021: 50.19
            New "hidden" command kill
	    Fixed a bug extracting files with -force over existing (but different) ones
	    
26-03-2021: 50.18
            Fixed some aesthetic detail
22-03-2021: 50.17
            Fixed the "magical" help parser
			
			+Added -minsize X and -maxsize Y on the add(), list() and sha1() functions
			       zpaqfranz a z:\1.zpaq c:\nz -maxsize 1000000
			
			+Added exec_on something / exec_error something
					execute (system()) a file after successfull (all OK) or NOT (errors/warnings)
					Typically this is for sending an error e-mail alert message
					Something like (with smtp-cli)
					
					smtp-cli 
					--missing-modules-ok 
					-verbose 
					-server=mail.mysmtp.com 
					--port 587 
					-4 
					-user=log@mysmtp.com 
					-pass=mygoodpassword
					-from=log@mysmtp.com
					-to log@mysmtp.com 
					-subject  "CHECK-ZPAQ" 
					-body-plain="Something wrong" 
					-attach=/tmp/checkoutput.txt
